in this challange we get zip file, when we unzip the file we get lot of folders inside without any file. By the command "tree" we can see the structure of the folders

After looking in google for "Folders lang" - I run into this git repository https://github.com/SinaKhalili/Folders.py , it a simple script that explain how to write code in folders.

So I download this project and run it on our folders:

As we can see we get url that give as another clue

So in this video the word that we need to send is "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious", by simple rules of the Folders lang we create an zip file and send to the server and get our flag.

After we create the folders we can check if it correct
